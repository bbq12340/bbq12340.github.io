What's up y'all! My name is Jaehyuk David Jang but most people call me by the initial J or by my last name. I created this blog to post some reviews and notes of my studies, but traveling and cooking is also my thing so I would like to post some of that too. I currently am studying my Bachelor's degree at Soongsil University, South Korea and just finished my exchange program from the Florida State University.

안녕하세요 장재혁입니다! 현재 숭실대학교에서 재학 중이고 통계학을 전공하고 있습니다. 블로그는 관심 있는거 끄적이려고 만들었습니다. 취미는 여행과 요리.
