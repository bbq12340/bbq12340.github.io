What's up y'all! My name is Jaehyuk David Jang but most people call me by Jay or my last name. I created this blog to post some reviews and notes of my studies, but traveling and cooking is also my thing so I would like to post some of that in the future too. I currently am studying my B.S. at Soongsil University, South Korea and just finished my exchange program at the Florida State University. My particular research interest area is high dimensional econometrics. I have only read some articles about it and will be training myself to be adequate enough to write one paper about it. I have worked as a data mining specialist, solo, not in a company in 2020 and my favorite language is Python.
