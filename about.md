What's up y'all! My name is Jaehyuk David Jang but most people call me by the initial J or by my last name. This blog was made because I wanted to post some reviews and record my studies, but traveling and cooking is also my thing so I would like to post some of that too. I currently am studying my Bachelor's degree at Soongsil University, South Korea and just finished my exchange program from the Florida State University.
